# Hey, I'm Kaushik

> Deep in build mode — shipping on-chain products, infra, and developer tools across Solana & EVM. Turning ideas into mainnet code at hacker speed.

I’m a full stack Web3 developer who loves building, experimenting, and sharing what I learn along the way. My repos mostly revolve around React, Next.js, Solidity, Rust, and TypeScript, with a growing focus on decentralized identity, ZK, and modular infrastructure.

Beyond code, I’m active in the Web3 ecosystem hosting dev events, writing explainers, and helping other builders get started.
