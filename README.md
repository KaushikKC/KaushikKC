# Hey, I'm Kaushik


I’m a full stack Web3 developer who loves building, experimenting, and sharing what I learn along the way. My repos mostly revolve around React, Next.js, Solidity, Rust, and TypeScript, with a growing focus on decentralized identity, ZK, and modular infrastructure.

I enjoy keeping things simple clean code, smooth UX, and projects that actually solve problems. You’ll also find some of my event projects and open-source experiments here, from blockchain integrations to community-driven apps.

Beyond code, I’m active in the Web3 ecosystem hosting dev events, writing explainers, and helping other builders get started.

Always open to ideas, feedback, or collabs feel free to drop by and explore.
